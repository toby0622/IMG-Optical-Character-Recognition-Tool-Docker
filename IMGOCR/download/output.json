Fingerprint is considered as a dominant biometric trait dueto its acceptability, reliability, high security level and low cost. Due to the high demand on fingerprint identification system deployments, a lot of challenges are keep arising in each system's phase including fin- gerprint image enhancement, feature extraction, features matching andfingerprint classification. Machine learning techniques introduce non tra-ditional solutions to the fingerprint identification challenges.

Driven from the security needs for the electron- ically connected world, biometrics identification compensates some weaknessesof token- and knowledge-based identification in terms of loss, duplication andtheft. Biometrics traits contain iris pattern, retinal scan, fingerprints, voice andsignature. Fingerprint is one of the dominant biometrics traits that keeps spread-ing out because its uniqueness, acceptability, and low cost [1]. According to thebiometrics market and industry report [2], Fig. 1 represents the total fingerprint revenue which is around 66 compared to the other biometrics technologies. In spite of fingerprint identification provides high security level and it haslarge application domains, fingerprint identification system will be explainedin Section 2.2 is attacked by many challenges that lead to system performance are found in fingerprint acquisition, fingerprint preprocessing and enhancement,feature extraction, fingerprint matching and fingerprint classification [4]. How-ever, these problems have been tackled by many researches using different tech-niques in order to enhance the overall identification system performance, theideal solutions for some of these problems are still unavailable.A.

Biometrics technologies deployment in 2009Machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks ANN, Sup-port Vector Machine SVM and Genetic Algorithms GA [5l play an importantrole for presenting non traditional solutions for fingerprint identification prob-lems. The idea behind these techniques is to build a feature vector and trainlearn the machine how to process that vector according to some particularrules. This way, machine learning techniques can process effciently the compli-cated fingerprint data, and hence, contribute in solving some problems of thefingerprint identification system.The contribution of this paper is to introduce a precise survey about somemachine learning techniques that have been used in fingerprint identification.The survey can be used as ground truth for developing new machine learningbased algorithms for fingerprint identification system. The methodology of thisresearch is to consider only the most promising techniques in machine learningand their deployment in some phases of the fingerprint identification system.preliminary information about the fingerprint identification system componentsstaring from fingerprint acquisition phase and ending with fingerprint match- ing phase. Moreover, fingerprint structure has been explained as a first part of that section. Section 3 reports the research progress of deploying three machinelearning techniques, namely, ANN, SVM and GA over fingerprint identification system. Finally, conclusions and future work have been reported in Section 4. Fingerprint Identification2This section covers the fingerprint identification system in order to fully under- stand the implementations of the machine learning techniques in each phase. Fingerprint Structure2.1 Fingerprint is defined as the ridge and valleys formed on the fingertip [6]. It is constructed from harmonic patterns of alternating ridges and valleys. However, fingerprint ridges and valleys are parallel in most regions, several deformingfeatures such as scars, cuts, cracks and calluses, are also present on the fingerA.I.Awad526Fig.2.

In common, there are three representation levels of fingerprints: i Globalstructure, ii Local structure, and iii Low level structure [8]. Fig.2 shows threedifferent examples of fingerprint images with ridges and valleys representations.print. In global structure, a single representation is valid for the entire fingerprintimage [9]. Another important feature of the global structure is the singular pointsCircles and Triangles in Fig. 2 [10]. Singular points are unique for each fin-gerprint class, therefore, they are widely used as a feature for fingerprint coarseregistration and classification [11]. The local fingerprint structure represents theridges and valleys format at local interesting region. The most famous ridge property is ridge ending and ridge bifurcation it is called Minutiae [12], [13]. The local structure is mostly used in fingerprint matching because minutiae arethe highest discriminant feature of fingerprint images. The low level level-3structure considers the sweat pores on the fingerprint skin. The low level struc-ture is difficult to get captured as it needs properly environment with very highresolution sensor that requires high cost [8]2.2 Fingerprint Identification System Automatic Fingerprint Identification System AFIS has replaced human experts in fingerprint recognition as well as classification. It consists of two phases: iEnrollment phase and ii Identification phase. The enrollment phase is directedto register the individual identity in the database for future usage. While, the identification phase is responsible for extracting the individual identity from thedatabase according to the user claimed identity [3].Each phase is decomposed into the following sub-stages: i Fingerprint ac-quisition, ii Preprocessing, iii Feature extraction and iv Database storage. Fig. 3 shows the flowchart of fingerprint identification system. Generally speak-ing, fingerprint acquisition, preprocessing and feature extraction are the commonstages for both enrollment and identification. However, fingerprint matching is an extra mandatory step for the identification phase to extract the claimed iden-tity from the pre-collected database [1]. Processing time and identification accu-racy are two import factors for increasing the system performance [3].

A flowchart of fingerprint identification system basic componentslearning techniques can be good contributors for enhancing the system perfor-mance as reported in Section 3. Machine Learning TechniquesMachine learning systems are concerned with building fixable algorithms or tech- ing [14]. Machine learning system is first trained with source data, and following, it is used to perform required operations according to its acquired experience.The problem of machine learning techniques is related to their sensitivity tothe training data and the training parameters as they may produce differentresults by changing the training data. However machine learning includes manytechniques such as Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, GeneticAlgorithms, Bayesian Training and Probabilistic Models [15], we will stress onlyon the implementation of the first three techniques on fingerprint identification.3.1 Artificial Neural NetworksArtificial Neural Networks is the most widely used algorithm of the machinelearning system [16]. The quality assurance of the acquired fingerprint image is an important process before the feature extraction. Xie and Qi [17] designed asupervised back propagation neural network that uses the gray scale fingerprintimage for continuous image quality estimation. The problems of this methodare the lack of evaluation as it has been evaluated for small fingerprint imagesfrom Fingerprint Verification Competition 2002 FVC2002[18]. Moreover, thefingerprint image needs to be divided into blocks which is computationally ex- pensive process before running the proposed method. Zhu et al. [19] used theridge orientation. The correct ridge orientation is estimated using the trainedneural networks. Labati et al. [20] proposed the usage of neural network for im-age quality measurement in contactless fingerprint acquisition. They discoveredA.I. Awad528a set of new features for contactless images and designed a neural network toextract the complex features for future fingerprint matching. The bottleneck ofthis method is the computational complexity as it needs 1.5 to 3.7 seconds forthe implementation of the region of the interest needed for that method.identification. Liu et al. [2l] used back propagation neural network for singu-lar point detection from the gray scale fingerprint images. The problem of thismethod is the image division process as the image needs to be divided into smallblocks 35x35 pixels which is time consuming operation, and the location ofthe detected singular point is not accurate. Bartunek et al. [22] used the back propagation natural networks for extracting minutiae points ridge terminationand bifurcation from thinned fingerprint images. A sliding 5× 5 pixels windowhas been used to access the whole fingerprint image searching for minutia points.The problem with this method is the huge processing time to get the thinnedimage. Yang et al. [23] used the fuzzy neural networks for minutiae extraction from the gray scale image with high invariant to rotation and gray level changes.Fingerprint classification is an important process for reducing the identifica-tion time. Sarbadhikari et al. [24] proposed two-stage fingerprint classifier. Inthe second stage, Multi-Layer Perceptron MLP feed forward neural network accuracy was around 84. Mohamed and Nyongesa [25] proposed the usage offuzzy neural networks as a classification mechanism due to its ability to workas an adaptive filter in order to produce reliable results. They constructed a feature vector using five different parameters including number of core points,number of delta points, directional image, core point direction, and the positionof delta point. The algorithm achieved 85.0 for classifying the Left Loop class,and 98.35 for classifying the Whorl class. Kumar and Vikram [26] used multi-dimentional ANN MDANN for fingerprint matching using minutiae points.The algorithm achieved a maximum recognition rate as 97.37.Kristensen et al. [27] presented a comparative study on different neuralnetworks and support vector machine. They implemented four types of neu-ral networks including Multi-Layer Perceptron MLP, Bidirectional Associative Memory BAM, Hopfield and Kohonen neural networks, as well as the support vector machine. They concluded that MLP neural network achieved the best per- class problem. Support一vector machine came in the second rank with classification rate about 87.0,but both classifiers failed to classify most of Tented Arches class. In general, the other three classifiers could not perform well compared to multi-layer perceptronand support vector machine. Support Vector Machine3.2 Support Vector Machine is a training algorithm for linear classification, regres- sion, principal component analysis and for non-linear classifications. The ideabehind the support vector machine is to maximizing the margin between thetraining patterns and the decision boundary [16]. Machine Learning Techniques for Fingerprint Identification529classified into high, medium and low quality images with the accuracy of 96.03. The problem with Liu's method is the long processing time of the feature extrac-tion step. Zhao et al. [29] implemented support vector machine for fingerprintimage segmentation as it is an important step before feature extraction. Theydivided the image into 12 x 12 pixels blocks, and five features have been usedto construct the feature vector. These features are gray mean, gray variance,contrast, coherence and the main energy ratio. The proposed method is con-sider as robust for small scale evaluation. From the other side, Li et al. [30] usedthe support vector machine for fingerprint classification into 5 - classes withtotal achieved accuracy 93.5 with a combination of singular points and orien-tation image. However, using the orientation coefficients only produced 87.4and using singular point only produced 88.3 at maximum3.3Genetic AlgorithmsGenetic Algorithms are promising machine learning techniques for solving fin- gerprint related problems. Mao et al. [31] succeeded to use genetic algorithm forsingular point extraction. They presented a new definition for core point loca- tion and orientation which is used as fitness function for the genetic algorithm.The challenge of this method is processing time is become higher with increasedaccuracy 1x1 pixels with 10° accuracy. Tan et al. [32] implemented geneticalgorithm for fingerprint matching process using optimized minutiae transfor- required times are 15 and 8 seconds for genuine and imposter matching, respec-tively. Therefore, an optimization process is become a crucial need.Tan et al. [33] developed a classification algorithm based on some new learned features. In the proposed approach, they tried to find unconventional primitivesfrom the orientation images using the Genetic Programming GP technique.The learned features might never be imagining by humans experts. Then, aBayesian classifier was used for conducting the actual classification process. The proposed method was evaluated over the NIST-4 database [34]. The first 2000images were used for the training process, and the second 2000 were used forthe evaluation purposes. The total Percentage of Correct Classification PCCwas about 93.3 and 91.6 for the 4 - class and the 5 - class classificationproblems, respectively.Conclusions and Future WorkThis paper introduced a precise survey on the usage of machine learning tech-niques for solving some fingerprint identification problems. The paper hasfocused on three important techniques which are Artificial Neural Networks,Support Vector Machine and Genetic Algorithms, and their implementationson image quality measurements, feature extraction and fingerprint classifica-tion. The review confirms the superiority of using machine learning for tacklingA.I. Awad530different fingerprint identification problems. The future work will be targetedtoward developing one of machine learning technique for tackling some pendingfingerprint challenges such as processing time reduction and identification accu- racy enhancement. Moreover, another biometrics traits like palmprints and irispatterns will be considered as an applications of machine learning techniques.References1.
